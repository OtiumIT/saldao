Planning before implementation:
- Large Tasks: For any complex development or that involves multiple files/modules, ALWAYS create a detailed plan BEFORE starting to implement
- The plan should include:
  - Analysis of what needs to be done
  - Identification of affected files/modules
  - Dependencies and implementation order
  - Security and performance considerations
  - Validation with user before executing
  - Unit test suggestions at the end of the plan (which test cases would be important to validate the implementation)
- Exceptions: Simple changes (one file, small fixes) can be implemented directly
- When in doubt, always present the plan first

Incremental approach:
- Prefer incremental and testable implementations
- Break large tasks into smaller steps
- Validate each step before proceeding
- Avoid massive changes that affect many files at once
