description: "TypeScript patterns and rules: mandatory typing, avoid any, reuse shared types"
alwaysApply: true
---

NEVER use any - Always define explicit types or use unknown when necessary
Prefer interfaces for object types
Always check packages/shared-types before defining an interface that could be global or shared
If a type already exists in packages/shared-types, reuse it instead of creating a new one
Use shared types from packages/shared-types when available
Avoid as any or unnecessary type assertions
Type all function parameters, returns, and variables
Use generics when appropriate to create reusable code
TypeScript mandatory: always use .tsx for React components
TypeScript mandatory in backend
