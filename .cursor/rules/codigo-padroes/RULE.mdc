General patterns:
- Always use async/await instead of .then() when possible
- Use early returns to reduce nesting
- Descriptive names for variables and functions (Portuguese or English, be consistent)
- Functions should do one thing only (Single Responsibility Principle)
- Avoid code duplication, extract to reusable functions/components
- Comment complex code when necessary, but prefer self-explanatory code

Naming conventions:
- Files and folders: Use kebab-case (user-profile.ts, api-client.ts, auth-middleware.ts)
- React Components: Use PascalCase (UserProfile.tsx, Button.tsx, LoadingSpinner.tsx)
- Classes: Use PascalCase (AppError, ApiClient, UserService)
- Variables and functions: Use camelCase (getUserData, isAuthenticated, userId)
- Constants: Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS, API_BASE_URL)
- Types and Interfaces: Use PascalCase (User, ApiResponse, AuthConfig)

Git and versioning:
- Descriptive commits in Portuguese or English (be consistent)
- Do not commit sensitive files (.env, tokens, credentials)
- Use .gitignore appropriately

Documentation:
- Document complex functions with JSDoc
- Keep README.md updated
- Document important architectural decisions
- Comment code when necessary to explain why, not what

Testing (when implemented):
- Write unit tests for critical functions
- Integration tests for important flows
- Keep tests updated with code changes
